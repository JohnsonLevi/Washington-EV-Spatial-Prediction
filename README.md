# Washington-EV-Spatial-Prediction

Hello All, This is the final Project that I completed for Spatial Statistics at Colorado School of Mines. This project was done in collaboration with Drew Cornmesser and Collin Short. 

# Project

  The goal of this project was to create a spatial field in order to predict the EV Density throught the state of Washington. The final report for this project contains and explains much of the information about the project.

# Data

  The data used for this project was obtained at here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/qnqfbqfqo/electric-vehicle-population-in-washington-state
